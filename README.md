# 🏁 Pit Wall — Flaky CI Detective

**Created by:** Ishu & Prateek

> Flaky tests quietly burn developer time and CI money. Pit Wall catches them red-handed.

## The Problem

Flaky tests — tests that fail, then pass on re-run with **no code change** — are one of the most underrated sources of waste in modern software teams:

- Developers re-run pipelines "just to be sure," burning compute minutes.
- Real bugs get ignored because "oh, that test is just flaky."
- Nobody has a number to point to, so nobody prioritizes fixing it.

Most teams *feel* like their CI is flaky. Almost none of them can say **how flaky, which jobs, or how much it's costing them.** Pit Wall makes that visible.

## What Pit Wall Does

Give Pit Wall a GitHub repository, and it:

1. **Pulls recent GitHub Actions run history** for that repo.
2. **Finds jobs that both failed and passed on the exact same commit** — this is direct, undeniable evidence of flakiness (no code changed, yet the outcome flipped).
3. **Quantifies the damage** in wasted CI compute time.
4. **Diagnoses the worst offenders** using AI log analysis.
5. **Hands you a fix** — in the form of a ready-to-post GitHub issue.

In short: Pit Wall turns "our tests feel flaky" into a dashboard, a dollar/hour figure, and an actionable ticket.

## Features

### 🔢 Headline Number: Wasted CI Hours This Month
The single most important metric on the dashboard — total compute time spent re-running jobs that later turned out to be flaky (not genuine failures). Designed to be the number you show your engineering manager.

### 🏆 Flakiness Leaderboard
Ranks jobs/tests by flake frequency, with a trend chart showing whether flakiness is getting better or worse over time. Instantly spots the repeat offenders.

### 🕵️ AI Root-Cause Analysis
For the worst offending job, Pit Wall reads the actual failure logs and classifies the likely cause:
- **Timing / race conditions**
- **Network flakiness** (timeouts, DNS, rate limits)
- **Test ordering / shared state issues**
- Other (with reasoning)

### 📝 Suggested Fix + Ready-to-Post GitHub Issue
No more staring at a red build wondering what to do. Pit Wall drafts a GitHub issue with:
- The suspected root cause
- Evidence (linked failed/passed run pairs on the same commit)
- A suggested remediation approach (e.g., add retry logic, isolate test state, mock the flaky network call)

## How It Works (Under the Hood)

```
GitHub Actions API
       │
       ▼
Fetch recent workflow runs (per commit SHA)
       │
       ▼
Group runs by commit → detect commits with both PASS and FAIL outcomes
       │
       ▼
Flag job as "flaky" + compute wasted compute-minutes
       │
       ▼
Rank jobs → Leaderboard + Trend Chart
       │
       ▼
Pull failure logs for #1 flakiest job → feed to LLM
       │
       ▼
LLM classifies cause → drafts fix + GitHub issue
```

**Core signal:** same commit SHA + differing job outcome (pass vs. fail) across runs = flaky, not a real regression.
